BinarySearch:
  Complexity: O(log(n))
  Details: I love this algorithm. Personal favorite of mine. It is simple and elegant. The
    goal is to find an element in an ordered list. This is done by checking if the value
    being searched for is larger or smaller than the middle element. If the value is larger
    than the middle element, for example, then this is performed again on the right half of
    the list. The list is traversed piecewise in this manner, with the part of the array
    being searched is cut in half with each iteration.
